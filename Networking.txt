General network concepts
=============================
switch - connects devices in LAN.
router(gateway) - connects two networks. e.g Your home network will connect to internet through router.
	router has 2 ip address. one on LAN, anothr on WAN.
hub - A hub works on the physical layer (Layer 1) of OSI model while Switch works on the data link layer (Layer 2). 
	Switch is more efficient than the hub. A switch can join multiple computers within one LAN.
	Hub just connects multiple Ethernet devices together as a single segment.
Subnet mask - not an ip address. Indicates LAN range.
	Example. If IP address of device A is 192.168.10.11, subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, LAN range starts from 192.168.10.0 to 192.168.10.255. 
	This is how device A knows that if it needs to communicate to perticular IP address, will it find in LAN, or need to talk to router.
	
	
IP address
	Private
		Class A - 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 - 16,777,216 IP addresses
		Class B - 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 -  1,048,576 IP addresses
		Class C - 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 - 65,536 IP addresses
			
		classless with subnetting(CIDR)
		/32 - No Octet can change
		/24 - Last Octet can change
		/26 - Last 2 Octet can change
		/8 - Last 3 Octet can change
		/0 - All Octet can change

		--------
		In more detail
		192.168.0.0/32 allow for 1 IP - 2 pow 0
			   /31 allow for 2 IP - 2 pow 1
			   /30 allow for 4 IP - 2 pow 2
			   /29 allow for 8 IP - 2 pow 3
			   /28 allow for 16 IP - 2 pow 4
			   /27 allow for 32 IP - 2 pow 5
			   /26 allow for 64 IP - 2 pow 6

On windows inconfig returns you info about ip address. Notice below:
   Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . : lan
   IPv6 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 2607:fb91:1abf:c690::458
   IPv6 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : fd81:6834:9c0f::458
   Link-local IPv6 Address . . . . . : fe80::805b:d75f:def6:9ec2%3
   IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.12.202
   Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0    -- This is not an IP address
   Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.12.1     -- This is router ip address

Jan/5/2025: Macs absolutely use IPv4 and will continue to support it as long as networks rely on it. 
They just prioritize IPv6 if both options are available.

Subnet Mask: This is not an IP address. It indicates the part of our own IP address that form our LAN range.
255 is the significat field. 0 is the wild card.
255.255.255.0 means Last Octet can change
255.255.0.0 means Last 2 Octet can change
===================================================

hub
	- has many port like switch
	- not intelligent. doesnt have h/w mac table
	- like beater
	- 1 collision domain. - 2 device communicating. 3rd try to communicate with 1 of them, corrupts communication between 1 and 2
	- 1 broadcast domain. - sending to all device
	
bridge - more intelligent that hub, less than switch.

switch
	- knows mac address of all devie connected.
	- helps P2P communication rather that broadcast.
	- no of collition domain = no of device ports.
	- has CAM table

Router
	- intelligent.  many collision and broadcast domain.
	
2 address - IP layer 3, mac address layer 2.
Local communication
Data transmission using ethernet happens only using mac address.
ARP =Address reoltion protocol(broadcast). Device 1 sends ARP (with MAC )to switch. Received by everyone, Device 2 responds. 
Now device 1 knows IP address of Devie 2 and starts communication through switch.

External communication
Needs gateway(Router). Works at layer 3.(IP). Has routing table. packet goes through multiple router before reaching to destination.

Cisco switch doesn't have a power input, router has.

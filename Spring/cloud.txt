ConfigServer
	Advantage
		- Makes it easier to change configuration because we just need to update config server. Else update all services.
		- Update immediately even without retart
		- keep the passords encrypted and decryp inflight and provide to dependent microservices.

At Server
1.At start.sprint.io, choose - ConfigServer
2.@EnableConfigServer
3.spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri=https://github.com/shishirkumar123/spring-cloud-configuration-files.git
4.server.port=8888

5.Access a git file from browser-
e.g
http://localhost:8888/organization-unit
http://localhost:8888/organization-unit/master (Note that organization-unit is the service id 
													which you specified in property file for spring.application.name)

Try below also -
http://localhost:8888/reservation-service.properties
http://localhost:8888/reservation-service.properties/master -> anything works in place of /master. What is the purpose?(fallback?)


6.Notice console-

NativeEnvironmentRepository  : Adding property source: file:/C:/Users/shish/AppData/Local/Temp/config-repo-12952748685696729466/reservation-service.properties
NativeEnvironmentRepository  : Adding property source: file:/C:/Users/shish/AppData/Local/Temp/config-repo-12952748685696729466/application.properties

Q. So it seems everytime a property value is needed by a config client, it will not hit the git.uri, but it will pick from local cache. Any change in the
property at git.uri location will not be reflected in config clients. May be that is where actuator comes into picture.
A. Yes.

Can use consul/zookeeper as well.

7.Extra
	Try this -
	http://localhost:8888/actuator
	http://localhost:8888/actuator/info
	http://localhost:8888/actuator/health

	When i put below property in application.properies -
	spring.profiles=dev
	I restart ther server i get below error message -
		Description:

		Invalid config server configuration.

		Action:

		If you are using the git profile, you need to set a Git URI in your configuration.  If you are using a native profile and have spring.cloud.config.server.bootstrap=true, you need to use a composite configuration.

-----------------
At github
1.Put organization-unit.properties - Follow naming convension else it wont work. I guess it has to be same as spring.application.name
server.port: 8001
debug: true
message: hello2
-----------------
At Client(organization-unit) - 
1. From start.spring.io choose Web, Rest Repository, JPA, H2, Config Client, Stream Redis, Zipkin
2.pom.xml
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-config</artifactId>
		</dependency>
3.application.properties
	spring.application.name=organization-unit
	spring.cloud.config.uri=http://localhost:8888
	[Better to use environment variable like spring.cloud.config.uri=${CONFIG_SERVER}]
	[Many internet post suggest that the two property should go in bootstrap.yml file. But it works fine with application.yml as well(verify)
	From stackoverflow - "Bootstrap.yml or Bootstrap.properties is used to fetch the config from Spring Cloud Server."]
4.Controller
	@Value("${message}")
	public String message;

	@RequestMapping("/message")
	public String message() {
		return this.message;
	}

actuater info health


Access-
1.http://localhost:8001/api/v1/organizations
2.http://localhost:8001/api/v1/organizations/message
3.http://localhost:8888/organization-unit/master
	Notice the hierarchy.
		It shows content both from organization-unit.properties and application.properties(which is a fallback for organization-unit.properties)


=====================================================================================================================================


Actuator
At organization-unit
1. pom.xml
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
		</dependency>

2. info health env
	http://localhost:8001/actuator
	http://localhost:8001/actuator/info
	http://localhost:8001/actuator/health
	 
3. refresh scope
	@RefreshScope - At the top of the class. Will it work at the top of method also?
	@RequestMapping("/message")
	public String message() {
		return this.message;
	}
4. Access http://localhost:8080/api/v1/organizations/message
	Change value in organization-unit.properties
		message: hello2
	curl -d{} http://localhost:8080/actuator/refresh		--This url not working. check endpoint url. [-d{} for POST. without that GET]
	Add below entries in bootstrap.properties to make it work -
		management.security.enabled=false
		endpoints.actuator.enabled=true
		management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=refresh
Access URL again. It should show changed value.


====================
Eureka
[For comprehensive coverage, see https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/reference/html/]
Better alternative to DNS - DNS is dumb, doesnt know whether the service exist, if exists then is it up? 
Have to put time out at client side. Load balancer is just round-robin, 
cant do availabilityzoneAware, can have state for things like streaming video, cant do client side load balancing.

Client side load balancing component is Ribbon.
At server
1.start.spring.io - Eureka Server
2. On Application class - @EnableEurekaServer
3.application.properties  - 
	spring.application.name=eureka-service
	spring.cloud.config.uri=http://localhost:8888
4. At browser - localhost:8761

At microservice - 
1.@EnableDiscoveryClient
	Don't we need to tell the microservice, the url of eureka server?
	Yes in application.properties - eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone=http://localhost:8761/eureka


Different ways to discover a microservice from other microservice -
1. Using DiscoveryClient -
	//Autowire discoveryClient and then-
	List<ServiceInstance> instances = discoveryClient.getInstances("organization-unit");
	ServiceInstance serviceInstance = instances.get(0); //manually choosing
	String baseURL = serviceInstance.getUri().toString();
	...
	response = restTemplate.exchange(baseURL, ...);

2. Using Load Balancer client - 
	//Autowire loadBalancerClient and then-
	ServiceInstance serviceInstance = loadbalancer.choose("organization-unit");

Q. How multiple instances of organization-unit is created which are collectively identified by same name say organization-unit?
When we put spring.application.name is property file, isn't the same name used for registration with eureka?
A. 1.Add below entries in application.properties - 
	spring.application.name=organization-unit
	eureka.instance.instanceId=${spring.application.name}:${random.value}
   2. Start the producer twice. First with server.port=8081, then with server.port=8082.
   [intelligJ - Based on IntelligJ version, by default you may not be allowed to un the server twice. Enable it -
   	Run>>Edit Configuration>>Allow run in parallel]

Q. At an organization level, how many eureka server implementation we need? For my own project I might create my
own eureka server(with multiple instances obviously) but when services from my project need to call services from
other project, will they obtain the reference through their eureka server?

Note the following message in console of organization-unit microservice(using spring-cloud.version - Hoxton)
As Spring Cloud Ribbon is in maintenance mode. We recommend switching to BlockingLoadBalancerClient instead.

Client side load balancing vs server side load balancing - https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/server-vs-client-side-load-balancing-ramit-sharma/

Advantages of server-side load balancing:
    -Simple client configuration: only need to know the load-balancer address.
    -Clients can be untrusted: all traffic goes through the load-balancer where it can be looked at.
    -Clients are not aware of the backend servers.

Advantages of client-side load balancing:
    -No more single point of failure as in the case of the traditional load balancer approach.
    -Reduced cost as the need for server-side load balancer goes away.
    -Less network latency as the client can directly invoke the backend servers removing an extra hop for the load balancer.

Q. I have noticed that once microservices are registered with eureka, you you shutdown one of them, 
eureka takes certain time to unregister it. How much time it takes? Is the below message on web console related -
"EMERGENCY! EUREKA MAY BE INCORRECTLY CLAIMING INSTANCES ARE UP WHEN THEY'RE NOT. RENEWALS ARE LESSER THAN THRESHOLD 
AND HENCE THE INSTANCES ARE NOT BEING EXPIRED JUST TO BE SAFE."
Is the load balancer intelligent enough not to forward request to the stopped server?

Q. In case of client side load balancing, every client has got a load balancer. Are they aware of each other? How each load balancer is aware about the load at each instances of server instance?
A. The load balancers on individual clients are not aware of each other. Instead, they rely on the service registry (like Eureka in Spring Cloud) to obtain information about available instances of a service

====================
Edge service
2 type - microproxy - blindly fwds inside datacenter to the services behind the loadbalancer, 
		API gateway - transforms and then forwards.

All the clients like mobile phone, smart watches etc. will call the edge service discovering it through DNS. Edge service
will then forward it to the actual microservice. There can be multiple edge service transforming a request in different 
way, or handling security in different wayHTTPBasic, OAuth, SSL), or handle certain protocols differently, then calling 
actual microservice.

Another example, client like HTML file need to avoid CORS restrictions, so they need to stay on same host and port, so the service
need to allow them by addtion some code. If I have 600 service, I wont go and add that code in all service, rather I will do
at edge service which is acting as microproxy here just rounting the request without doing any else like transformation.

At Edge microservice -
1. At start.spring.io -Eureca Discovery, Config Client, Hystrix(circuit breaker), Zuul(micro proxy), Stream Redis, 
	Zipkin(distributed tracing)
2.At application java file
	@EnableDiscoveryClient
	@EnableZuulProxy
3. At property file(bootstrap) -
	spring.application.name=organization-unit-client
	spring.cloud.config.uri=http://localhost:8888
4. Call actual microservice through edge service in the browser -
	localhost:9999/organization-unit/organization - where edge service is running on 9999 and actual microservice identifier is 
	organization-unit and /organization is the end point implemented in actual microservice. 

Extra steps if you need to do transformation too -
1. pom.xml
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-hateoas</artifactId>
		</dependency>
2. call restTemplate.exchange to actual service.
	Note - If you have multiple service calls to make, better to user reactive programming call all APIs
	asynchronously and zip the results upon completion. Even if it is single API but expecting huge number of records,
	rx java could be a good fit.
    or 
	restTemplate.getForObject("http://billing-service/api/billing", String.class);
    
    or use FeignClient

	@FeignClient("billing-service") // Service name in Eureka
	public interface BillingClient {
	    @GetMapping("/api/billing")
	    String getBillingInfo();
	}
	-----
	Use the Feign clients in your service:
	@Service
	public class OrderService {
	
	    @Autowired
	    private BillingClient billingClient;
	
	    public String createOrder() {
	        String billingResponse = billingClient.getBillingInfo();
=====================================
RestTemplate methods comparision

Feature				exchange				getForObject	getForEntity
Control over HTTP Method	Full control (GET, POST, DELETE, etc.)	GET only	GET only
Response Content		Full response (ResponseEntity)		Body only	Full response (ResponseEntity)
Custom Headers			Fully customizable			Not supported	Not supported
Use Case			Complex, custom scenarios		Simple data retrieval	Data retrieval with metadata

========================
Hystrix 
Hystrix is a latency and fault tolerance library. Two important feature is -
 Circuit breaker - isolate points of access to remote systems, services and 3rd party libraries, stop cascading failure 
 Fallback method - enable resilience in complex distributed systems where failure is inevitable.


At Edge Service
1. Ensure Hystrix dependency is proper in pom.xml
2. At Application java - @EnableCircuitBreaker
3. implement fallBack method with different name but exactly same singnature as original method. put fallback code there.
4. Annotate the original method(endpoint) - @HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod="<fallBackMethodName>")


Ribbon load balancer(client side load balancer) - can be customized programmed. By default it does round robin.
	You can make it availabilityzoneAware, StikiSessionAware etc.

Fallbacks works straight with read operations. But for write operations, situation is more complex where you need statefulness.
It is adviced not to use distributed transaction(slow and not full proof), better use eventual consistency(messaging).

Circuit breaker ensures that call is not made to the main method at all but goes directly to fallback avoiding network traffic.
Visualize this by putting log statements in both main method (with exception thrown) and fallback method. 
No extra setting is required. Just start calling main method repeatedly and see the log. Multiple calls can be made from
postman or a client microservice with for loop. 

@HystrixCommand vs @CircuitBreaker
@HystrixCommand comes from the Hystrix library (legacy, no longer maintained).
    @HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod = "defaultResponse")
    public String getData() {
        // Simulate a long-running or failing operation
        return restTemplate.getForObject("http://some-external-service", String.class);
    }
@CircuitBreaker comes from the Resilience4j library (lightweight, actively maintained, and modular)
    
    @CircuitBreaker(name = "backendA", fallbackMethod = "fallback")
    public String getData() {
        // Simulate a long-running or failing operation
        return restTemplate.getForObject("http://some-external-service", String.class);
    }

=====================================
Messaging
Spring cloud stream - is the way to describe messaging based services and then composing them outside the code. It uses 
	an abstraction called channel(name conduit) where the producer put the message, and spring cloud stream will ensure that
	their is a broker at receiving end which will forward the message to some other component. What that component is, where
	it is etc are described in configuration file outside the code.

At Edge service(Edge Service is a producer in this case)
1.	Ensure the pom.xml is stream-redis
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-redis</artifactId>
		</dependency>

2. At Java Application
	@EnableBinding(Source.class) 
	Note that Source.class is provided by spring out of the box. It can be replaced by any interface which has 
	message channel defination.

3. At Java Controller
	@Autowire 
	private Source source

	@PostMapping
	public void myMethod(@RequestBody SomeMessageEntity m){
		Message<String> msg = build the message
		this.source.output().send(msg);
	}

	When you browse the config server for edge server properies in browser(localhost:8888/edge-service/master), you will see below-
	spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input=<name> --this is the named conduit using which producer and consumer will communicate.
	The actual broker is abstracted, which can be RabbitMQ, kafka

 At actual microservice -
 1. At Java Application
	@EnableBinding(Sink.class) at Main class.
	Create anothe class in the same file-

	@MessageEndpoint
	class SomeProcessor{

		@ServiceActivator(inputChannel = Sink.INPUT)
		public void acceptMessage(String msg){
			//receive the message and save to database.
		}
	}

Test
	Use postman or something to invoke the Source controller which will send message, which should be received by Sink.

=============================
Hystrix dashboard
New microservice
1. At start.spring.io - Hystrix Dashboard, Config Client
2. At Java Application - @EnableHystrixDashboard
3.bootstrap.properties
	spring.application.name=hystrix-dashboard
	spring.cloud.config.uri=http://localhost:8888

At browser - 
1. Type the URL localhost: 8010/hystrix.html
2. In the webpage, put localhost:<port>/hystrix.stream where port is where edge server is running.
	[You can verify the stream url by directly putting it in the browser and see the output in the browser]



Distributed tracing
==============================
Distributed tracing using sleuth.
Sleuth instruments RabbitMQ, Spring MVC, Feign(Declarative Rest client) by adding headers
Sleuth will write that output to Zipkin.(Zipkin is one implementation of sleuth abstraction)

At organization-unit
1. At Java Application -
Add new method

@Bean
Sampler<?> sampler(){
	return new Sampler<Object>(){
		@Override
		public boolean next(Object info){
			return true; //means always sample(trace every request)
		}
	};
}

Better code with lambda- (Use replace with lambda option from IntelliJ)
Sampler<?> sampler(){
	return info -> true;
}

-------------------
Need to have zipkin installed - directly or through docker and see the zipking dashboard. 
It will show end to end journey of a request.

How to create multiple instance of a microservice. Run it. In property file, change the port and run it again. But this requires manual intervention. How a platform
create multiple instances?

What is the benefit of client side load balancer like ribbon as opposed to F5. for client side load balancing, how can client be aware about load on 
various service instances since it is not aware about other client consumers?

How to secure microservices from each other. Not any microservice should be able to call another microservice without being aware about it. In fact, not even UI.
How can I view who is calling my microservices?

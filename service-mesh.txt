Eureka

AWS Cloud Map: Best for AWS-native microservices.
Azure Service Fabric: Best for applications using Azure's Service Fabric framework.
Istio or Consul: Ideal for cross-cloud or hybrid environments.
Eureka: You can deploy Spring Cloud Eureka on EC2 or Azure VMs 
	if you prefer a custom-managed solution.
-------------------

Config Server
Use AWS Systems Manager or Azure App Configuration for a centralized, 
	managed configuration solution.
Use AWS Secrets Manager or Azure Key Vault for secure and sensitive configuration values.
For cloud-agnostic setups, consider deploying Spring Cloud Config Server 
	on the cloud or using third-party tools like Consul.
K8S - ConfigMap and Secret

Popular Sidecar Examples
Envoy: Used in service meshes like Istio for traffic management and security.
Fluentd: For log aggregation and forwarding.
Consul-Template: For dynamic configuration updates.
Vault Agent: For managing secrets injection.
The sidecar pattern is a powerful tool in modern microservices architecture, 
enhancing modularity and maintainability.

Service Mesh - Istio vs Consul
Feature			Istio																Consul
Primary Focus	Service mesh for traffic management, observability, and security.	Service discovery, service mesh, and key-value store for configuration.
Traffic Control	Advanced (e.g., retries, fault injection, traffic splitting).		Basic (e.g., traffic splitting, failovers).
Architecture	Sidecar-based (Envoy proxy).										Can operate without sidecars but supports them optionally (via Consul Connect).
Ease of Use		Steeper learning curve; more complex setup.							Easier to start with, especially for service discovery.
Cloud-Native	Kubernetes-native; works best with Kubernetes.						Multi-platform: Kubernetes, VMs, on-premises.
Key-Value Store	Not included.														Built-in KV store for configurations.


Recommendation
Istio is generally considered "better" than Consul when it comes to a full-featured 
service mesh, particularly for complex deployments with advanced traffic management needs, 
as Istio offers more robust capabilities for routing, security, and observability

If your application is simple and doesn't require advanced traffic management or telemetry, 
Consul is the pragmatic choice. It is lightweight and easy to use.

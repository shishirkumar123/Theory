ECR - Elastic container Registry
     keeps container images
     Advantage - integrate well with AWS services. When new version of image arrives, notify the K8s cluster.

(Compare with Amazon Container Service)

>aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 062286665809.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
	- username is AWS for everyone for ecr, password is account id.
	- this command obtains ecr login/pwd
	- pipes it to docker login
	Note:
	- AWS ECR does not support permanent credentials
	- This password is valid for 12 hours
You will get the message: Login Succeeded
	
>aws ecr create-repository --repository-name ns1/my-ecr-01  # (If repo doesn't exist)
>docker build -t my-image-01 .(do it locally (-possibly in your laptop) if not yet)
>docker tag my-image-01:latest 062286665809.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-ns-01/my-ecr-01:v1
	my-image-01 is the image name, 'latest' is the tag (default if none is specified) in laptop.
	my-ecr-01 is the ecr name in aws, 'v1' is the tag (default if none is specified) in ecr.
	verify using >docker images

>docker push 062286665809.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-ns-01/my-ecr-01:v1


Verify:
>aws ecr list-images --repository-name ns1/my-ecr-01 

Verify the size:
>docker image inspect 062286665809.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ns1/my-ecr-01:v1

I notice that size of image in my latop was 148MB, but in ECR it is 60MB.

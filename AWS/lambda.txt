AWS Lambda
	 -It is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without
	  provisioning or managing servers.
	 -AWS manages the server maintenance, scaling, provisioning, logging
	 -Under the hood, lambda maintains server pool(EC2s). When you need to
	  run something, lambda will take a EC2 from pool, do the job and 
	  release the EC2.
	 -Use case
		-File processing
		-Stream processing
		-Web application
		-Mobile/Web backends
	-Can be written in node, python, java, javascript
	-Specify trigger to invoke lambda. eg.
		-File dropped in S3
		- Data arrived in dynamodb
		-request to API gateway
	-lambda gets the object in the form of event on which operation needs to be done

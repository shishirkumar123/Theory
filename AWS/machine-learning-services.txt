AWS ML Services
==============================

(classification vs regression
rfm model statistics)

1. Rekognition - image						- Tranformer, Deep learning, neural network
2. Transcribe - speech to text				- Tranformer, LSTM (type of RNN)
3. Polly - text to speech					- Tranformer, LSTM (type of RNN)
4. Translate - text to text(eng to hindi)  - Tranformer, LSTM (type of RNN)
5. Lex - Alexa, Chatbots					- Tranformer, LSTM ()
6. Comprehend - Read and analyze text
7. Sage Maker - fully managed machine learning (ML) service that helps developers 
			 and data scientists build, train, and deploy ML models at scale.
8. Forecast - fully managed service that uses machine learning (ML) to generate 
			accurate time-series forecasts for business metrics such as demand, 
			revenue, inventory levels, and resource planning
			
			DEPRECATED
			Use - SageMaker, Bedrock, Glue+QuickSight
			
9. Kendra - search on ppt free flow unstructured data using ML.
		Contrast this with Elasticsearch/Lucene which primarily match 
		keywords and provide ranked results.
10. Personalize - recomend
11. Textract - extract text
---------------
Use SageMaker if you need to train and deploy custom ML models with 
full control over infrastructure and data.
Use Bedrock if you want to quickly integrate generative AI models 
(like GPT-4, Claude, etc.) into applications without managing ML infrastructure.

Q. What to  to classify documents like phone bills, W2 forms, receipts, etc.
A.  For structured documents (invoices, receipts, W2s) → Use Amazon Textract
	For text-based classification (emails, legal docs, reports) → Use Amazon Comprehend
	For advanced, AI-driven classification → Use Amazon Bedrock + Textract/Comprehend
	
	In the given use case, use Amazon Textract and Amazon Comprehend to classify 
	documents like phone bills, W2 forms, receipts

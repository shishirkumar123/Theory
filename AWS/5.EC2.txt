"1. AWS Systems Manager Session Manager — The SSH Killer
Remember the days of managing SSH keys and dealing with bastion hosts? Those days are over. 
Session Manager provides secure shell access to your EC2 instances without opening inbound ports or managing SSH keys."

====================================================================================
EC2
=============
Instances
-----------
Creates instance by specifying
	- AMI
	- Instance type
	- key pair
	- Networking
	- storage
	- Advance settings
    While creating EC2:
	- Allow SSH to access, Allow HTTP is you are planning to run a web server
	- Attach EBS if needed. Also select whether or not you want to delete EBS if EC2 is deleted.
    After creating EC2
	- You can stop server when not using, to incure less bill.

Instance types:  (t-, c-, g-, m-, r- x- )
----------------
    Select EC2 based on need. Below are options -
	- compute optimized - good processor for batch process etc, 
	- memory optimized - lots of RAM for Cache, RDBMS, Business Intelligence, 
	- GPU enabled  
	- general purpose e.g T2 micro - good for web server, code repository
	- Storage - High frequency OLTP 
	- Your own manually configured.

Launch Template
----------------
	-Created using similar options that you get for EC2-
		- AMI
		- Instance type
		- key pair
		- Networking
		- storage
		- Advance settings
	-Can be used to launch
		- EC2 instance
		- ASG 
		- Spot fleet

Spot Requests
--------------------
Create using launch template or manual configuration

Savings Plans
------------------
	Low prices on EC2, Fargate and Lambda usage, in exchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of usage (measured in $/hour) for a 1 or 3 year term

Reserved Instances
------------------
	Like buying a computer. Specify o/s, instance type etc.
	You are billed for the reservation regardless of whether you fully use the capacity.
	Steady-state workloads (e.g., web servers, databases).
	Hardware is virtualized. It is not dedicated.
	Not suitable for BYOL

Dedicated Host
----------------
	Dedicated Hosts allow you to provision EC2 instances on physical servers fully dedicated for your use.
	(dedicated physical hardware)
	Suitable for BYOL (Bring your own liscence)
	
Capacity Reservations
----------------------

Images
=====================================================

Elastic block storage
=====================================================
Volume
-----------
Snapshot
-----------
Lifecycle Manager: Automate the creation, retention, copy and deletion of snapshots and AMIs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Network & Security
=====================================================
Security Group
------------------
Security Group are firewall for EC2 instances.
	I may allow my laptop to do SSH on my AWS a/c EC2, but no one else.
	One SG can be a firewall to more than one EC2 and vice versa( many to many)
	All incoming to EC2 blocked by default.
	All outgoing from EC2 are authorized by defalt.
	Does the EC2s of same SG allow each other by default?
Ports
	22 SSH, 21 FTP, 22 SFTP using SSH, 80 HTTP, 442 HTTPS, 3389 RDP 

Elastic IP:
----------------
	EC2 get a public IP assigned. But when you stop and start EC2, public IP changes.
	If you create elastic ip and attach to EC2, then stop/start wont change it.

Placement Groups
-----------------
	3 types
	- cluster
	- spread
	- partition
Key Pairs
-----------

Network interface
-------------------
An elastic network interface is a logical networking component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card.

Load Balancing
========================
Load Balancers - 4 types
-------------------
1. Application Load Balancer
-----------------
ALB is typically associated with private subnet.
AWS allows to to associate a public subnet with an application load balancer but show warning:
"The selected subnet is not a private subnet. This means that your internal load balancer can receive internet traffic.
You can proceed with this selection; however, to prevent internet traffic from reaching your load balancer, 
you must choose a private subnet or update this subnet’s route table in the VPC console"

2. 

Auto Scaling
=======================
Auto Scaling Group(ASG): 
	Fill details.
	Q. When Scale up, the new EC2s goes to which AZ/Subnet?
	A. While creating ASG, you specify VPC. Then you have an option to select from
	   all the subnets inside that VPC. (multiselect subnet)

	

Assignment
1. Assign role to EC2 to acces S3, to read IAM users. 
   Run aws iam list-users before and after attaching role and see the different.
2. Setup Node to run react, tomcat to run springboot, database
3. Run aws commands ( Note: cli already installed)
	- aws iam list-users
 	- aws configure
4. Create an elastic IP and attach to EC2.
5. Create ENI and attach to EC2.
6. Detaich ENI and attach to a different EC2.

# Not a good idea to connect to other EC2 by keeping its keys in my current EC2. Rather access through role.

Fargate
===========
Fargate is a compute service that runs containers, abstracting the underlying infrastructure. 
It's part of AWS's serverless offerings, enabling you to run containers without managing EC2 instances.

Initially - (App Package + AMI) were deployed on EC2.
Then - Container on EC2.
Then - ECSs - Made it easy to manage containers and clusters. 
			But user still had to manage EC2 instances on which these clusters/containers were running.	
Then Fargate - No need of EC2 instances. Fargate is a compute engine.
			- Hosts and manages container
			- Offers seemless scaling
			- Integrated with ECS/EKS

Spot Instance
------------------
While creating an EC2 there is an option to request spot instances. Good to select this option when use is intermittent. Like batch processing. It significantly reduces tco. 

While creating an EC2 specifying a VPC, subnet is mandatory(there are convinient default setting though), but selecting an IAM role is not mandatory.

While adding storage, by default a storage of 'root' volume type is already added. You can add more storage. Only volume type available is EBS. Within that, general purpose SSD is free, IOPS is not.

Before spinning up the instance creates the keys-
A key pair consists of a public key that AWS stores, and a private key file that you store. Together, they allow you to connect to your instance securely. For Windows AMIs, the private key file is required to obtain the password used to log into your instance. For Linux AMIs, the private key file allows you to securely SSH into your instance.

AMI vs docker - AMI is VM, Doker is container. AMI's are VM images basically. Docker containers are packaged mini-images that run on some VM in an isolated environment.
AssociatinG storage - what to pick S3/EBS?

EBS
-------
has no existance without EC2. So in AWS menu, we dont see EBS in compute section. We do see EFS which has an independent existance.

Resource Instance
------------------
	RIs are a commitment in exchange for discount. Specify needs like OS, Tenacity, Instance type, duration, payment option etc and get deals from Amazon and third party.
  
  
-------
LightSail
================================
- Easy way for developers to get started with a simple virtual private server (VPS) solution
- Provides compute, storage, networking capacity and capabilities to deploy and manage website and web application in the cloud.
- Includes everything you need to quickly launch your project - A VM, SSD based storage, data transfer, DNS management and an static IP.

-------
AWS Batch
================================
- AWS Batch enables you to easily and efficiently run batch computing workloads of any scale on AWS using Amazon EC2 and Amazon EC2 Spot.

Elastic Beanstalk
===============================
- With Elastic Beanstalk, you can deploy, monitor, and scale an application quickly and easily.

Cloud formation
===============================
- AWS infrastructure provisioning. You can use non AW Ssolution like Terraform which works with other cloud providers too.
contrast this with terraform which can be used with any cliud provider.
-------------------------------------------------------
AWS Outpost 
===================
- AWS Outposts brings native AWS services, infrastructure, and operating models to virtually any data center, co-location space, or on-premises facility. When you have applications that needs to be run on-prem and you need to communicate from your new application running on AWS cloud, this is very useful feature making your overall solution a hybrid approach.

-Unlike other hybrid solutions that require use of different APIs, manual software updates, and purchase of third-party hardware and support, Outposts provide a truly consistent developer and IT operations experience across on premises and cloud environments.

-Payment term is 3 years. cost $700 to $30000 per month depending on requirement - As of April 2020.
           1 m5.24xlarge, 11+ TB EBS ---> $7,196.96/month (General purpose)
           5 c5.24xlarge, 11+ TB EBS  ---> $13,733.38/month (Compute optimized)
           11 c5.24xlarge, 11+TB EBS  ---> $28,633.71/month (memory optimized)
           4 m5.24xlarge, 2 g4dn.12xlarge, 11+ TB EBS --->$18,735.61/month (Graphic optimized)

Question
When autoscaling EC2, does it create more instances, or it adds more memory/HD etc?
How S3 connects to EC2?


Assignment
----------------
1. Create an ASK whose EC2s have different configurations in terms of cpu and memory.

Q. When we say fargate is cheaper because it auto provisions based on needs and dont run when  not needed hence incur less charges. But with EC2 ASG group, aren't we achieving same thing?
A. With EC2 ASG, you often need a minimum number of instances running.
Even if ASG scales down, a baseline number of instances remain, leading to idle costs.
Fargate removes this idle cost completely.

With Amazon account -
Below items are created by default-
	Multiple regions
	One vpc per region
	Multiple availability zone per Region. Subnet of same/different VPC can be inside same availability zone.
	One route table per vpc(main).
	One Security Group of type EC2-VPC.
	One internet gateway per region or per VPC? Internet gateway is needed by those VPCs only which has at least one public subnet.
	One DHCP option set per region
	One NACL per region.
	
	Note that number of regions and AZs are fixed and decided by AWS. We dont create region/AZ.
	
What is not created by default-
	NAT Gateways
	Virtual private Gateways
	Customer Gateways
=====================	
Virtual Private Cloud: VPC
=====================================================================================================================
VPC Logically isolated portion of AWS cloud.' 
	cant go across regions. It will be within a region.
	Analogous to having my own data center inside AWS
	Go across all AZs withing the Region
----
Virtual network - By default instances within the VPCs are connected through Virtual network. 
We dont explicitly do anything. 
Try this - connection 2 instances within same subnet, across two subnet of same VPCs. 
The default route table(main) of a vpc shows a rule for local with the same CIDR which was
specified during VPC creation. Is this referring to this virtual network?

----
VPCs
Once VPC created, one IPv4 is created what you specified during VPC creation. That becomes primary IPv4. You can't delete it.
If you delete the default VPC, you can't get it back without getting help from VPC support.
Dedicated VPCs are fast but costly.
VPC cant be deleted till it has associated instance, associated NAT Gateway, Internet gateway, transit gateway, VPC peering. 
Other things like subnet, SG, NACL, routing table gets deleted in cascade fasion.
Enable DNS Hostname: Assigns public DNS hostnames to instances that have a public IP in this VPC.
Enable DNS Resolution: (Also known as enableDnsSupport). A setting in AWS VPC that determines whether the Amazon-provided DNS server is enabled for a VPC. This setting is critical for allowing resources in your VPC to resolve DNS names.
CIDR - Classless Inter-Domain Routing.
	size between /16 to /28
	first four and last for addresses not available for use
	VPC pairing require non-overlapping CIDR block

Valid CIDR combinations of VPC and subnets:
1. VPC -10.0.0.0/16 -- meaning 16 are fixed. Meaning subnets within this must start with 10.0
   Subnet1 - 10.0.0.0/24 - meaning 24 are fixed. Meaning EC2 within this must have IP starting with 10.0.0
   Subnet2 - 10.0.1.0/24 - meaning 24 are fixed. Meaning EC2 within this must have IP starting with 10.0.1
2. VPC - 10.0.0.0/24
   Subnet1 - 10.0.0.0/28
   Subnet2 - 10.0.0.192/28

Invalid combination:
1. VPC -10.0.0.0/24, Subnet 10.0.1.0 - "CIDR Address is not within CIDR Address from VPC." Because VPC CIDR indicates that subnet within it must start with 10.0.0

VCP limits - 200 subnets, 200 route tables, 500 SG, 50 inbound+outbound rules - per VPC.
5 VPC per region

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Availability zone


VPC can have multiple AZ. AZ belongs to a region.
	Provides low latency, High availability, fault tolerance
	e.g. us-east-1a, us-east-1b	
Local Zones - Closer to specific cities or industries. 
		Provides very low latency(regional proximity) for city specific apps.
		e.g. Los Angeles, Boston	
Wavelength Zones - Integrated with 5G mobile networks.
		Provides ultra low latency(5G optimized) for 5G apps.
		e.g. Verizon 5G in Boston, Tokyo
Interestig article:https://aws.plainenglish.io/you-have-misunderstood-aws-availability-zones-47cdea0a168a

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Subnet -  segment of VPC's IP. helps high resiliency and availability.
	Subnet is assigned to one AZ. Subnet cant go accross AZs.

For making a subnet public -
	- Create an internet gateway and associate with subnet
	- All instances(EC2 etc) should have public or elastic IP.
	- Configure all NACL and SG rules.

Public Subnets:
Resources directly use the IGW for outbound internet traffic.
Private Subnets:
Resources send outbound traffic to a NAT Gateway or other intermediary before reaching the IGW.
Isolated Subnets:
Subnets with no internet route wonâ€™t use the IGW at all.
This allows you to design complex architectures within the same VPC:

Public-facing workloads (e.g., web servers) can use the IGW directly.
Private workloads (e.g., backend services) can use a NAT Gateway for secure internet access.
Fully isolated workloads (e.g., databases) can avoid internet access entirely.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Route table 
	- Set of rules called routes to determine network traffic direction. (Internet traffic allowed or just local etc.). The default route table that is created when VPC is created is called 'main'. Route table and subnet relation is one to many. 
Route table - Associated with a VPC 
		Main for public, Private-RT for private. 
		Can be associated with one or more subnet
				  
		A route table is a set of rules that control how network traffic is directed. 
		It tells network devices (such as EC2 instances, routers, or gateways) where to 
		send data based on its destination IP address. 
		In AWS, route tables are essential for managing traffic within VPCs, 
		between subnets, and to external networks such as the internet, 
		on-premises data centers, or other VPCs.

Route table can be linked to internet gateway by 2 way-
	1. Select Route table>> Edit Route >> Add Route - Destination- 0.0.0.0/0, Target igw-xxxxxx.
	2. Select Route table>> Edge Association >>Link the IGW.
What is the difference?

Every VPC automatically comes with a main route table, which all subnets use by default unless explicitly associated with another route table.
Subnets gain internet access through their association with a route table that includes a route pointing to the IGW.
Subnet-specific associations always override the VPC's default route table.
While the IGW is shared at the VPC level, different subnets can have independent outbound routes:
Route table vs NACL - Route table has routing logic for traffic. NACL allows/disallows traffic acting as a firewall.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Internet Gateway(IGW)
	Type of NAT(network address translation) device that uses bidirectional communication.
	Translate from a private IP address to a single Public IP address.
	Provide access into the VPC and back out to the internet, attached to VPC.
	One per VPC.
----
CIDR rule - Each VPC has a CIDR rule. (CIDR is classless) 
	e.g 10.0.0.0/16  10.1.0.0/16
	Subnet has a block of IP address from the CIDR block.
	(Contrast CIDR with class A, class B, class C)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Egress Only Gateway
	Same as NAT Gateway but for IPv6
	Doesn't allow traffic back-in
	By default every IPv6 is publicly routable so there is not choice for public and private subnet.
	Unlike NATG, doesnt need elastic IP.
	Note: Terms - Egress-Outbound, Ingress-Inbound.

----
Differences Between IGW and Internet-Only Egress
Feature			Internet Gateway (IGW)				Internet-Only Egress
Communication Type	Bidirectional (inbound + outbound)		Outbound-only
Inbound Traffic		Allowed for resources with public IP		Not allowed
Outbound Traffic	Allowed						Allowed
Resources		Public subnets with public IPs			Private subnets with private IPs
Implementation		Directly through IGW				NAT Gateway (IPv4) / EIGW (IPv6)
Use Case		Public-facing resources				Private resources needing internet access

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DHCP(Dynamic Host Config Protocol) Option sets
	DHCP is a network management protocol used to 
	automatically assign IP addresses and other network configuration settings
	(such as subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS servers) to devices 
	(like computers, smartphones, or IoT devices) on a network
	Components:
		DHCP Server- responsible for managing and assigning IP addresses from a predefined pool or range.
		DHCP Client- any device on the network that requests configuration information from the DHCP server 
				like laptop
	In AWS, One DHCP option set already exist in the region.
	All the VPC in the region use same DHCP. While creating VPC, the choice was not even asked. 
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Elastic IP addresses - Static, charge associated. 

Network interface - An elastic network interface is a logical networking component in a VPC 
that represents a virtual network card. Associated with a subnet.
You can create a network interface, attach it to an instance, detach it from an instance, and attach it to another instance. The attributes of a network interface follow it as it's attached or detached from an instance and reattached to another instance.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAT gateway - Used by instances of private subnet to access internet. Outside world still cant access these instances.
	Only have one IP address.
	2 types - NAT Gateway(recommended, managed) and NAT instance. NAT gateway hours are charged based on usage and amount of data processed.
	Once NAT gateway is created, one network interface is also created. This can be viewed from EC2 >> Network and Security >> Network Interface. 
	Seems like Elastic IP address is automatically created and associated with NAT gateway when a NAT gateway is created. Verify.
	NAT gateway itself recide in public subnet.
	Can't be associated by NACL, only with SG.
	Aren't highly available, should have a NAT gateway in each AZ.
	Automatically scale with loads.
	
	Charges - April 2020
	$0.045 per GB Data Processed by NAT Gateways
	$0.045 per NAT Gateway Hour(Roughly $1 a day)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peering connections - VPC connecting to another VPC.
	Can be done withing the same account and different account. 
	Can be done in same region or different region.
	
	VPC Peering (Point to Point) is not transitive.

=========================================
Security
=========================================================
NACLs - You might setup network ACLs with rules similar to your security groups in order to add additional layer of security to your VPCs. For every subnet, an ACL is a must. A default NACL is created, when a subnet is created. NACL to subnet relation is one to many. Unlike SG, ACL is stateless.
	NACL applies at subnet level, SG applies at instance level.
	When traffic enters your network, it is filtered by NACLs before it is filtered by security groups.
e.g
Inbound rule:
Rule No. Protocol/Port/IP  Allow/Deny
100 	 All/All/0.0.0.0	Allow
*	Same			Deny
	- Lower rule number executed first.
        - * means all other conditions which are not covered in previous rule
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Security group - Instance level(EC2) firewall. Associated with a VPC.
Act as a firewall that controlls the traffic for one or more instances by adding rules to SG. Examples -
	SG for web server typically allows only port 80(HTTP), 443(HTTPS) traffic. May be add SSH at 22 to manage it.
	SG for database server may allow only port 1433(MS SQL), 3389(RDP).
It is recommended to create different SGs for different layers.
Default inbound rule - none (Nothing allowed)
Default ourbound rule -all (Everything allowed)
SG and EC2 has many to many relation
Security groups are stateful. If you allow inbound traffic on a specific port (e.g., SSH on port 22), the corresponding outbound traffic for that connection is automatically allowed, and vice versa.

When a VPC is created, a default SG is created which is associated with VPC. Till this time there is no subnet. That means there is no compute. So SG rules are not applied to anything. But when subnets are added and then EC2, Fargate etc are added on the subnet, and no other SG is added, does the VPC level rules apply to all the instances of all the subnets?

Q. when security group is stateful, why i have to specify both inbound and outbound rule?
A. The stateful nature applies only to return traffic for an already allowed request.
You need to define rules for initiating traffic in both directions to cover all use cases.

Note:	Security Groups Are Attached to ENIs, Not Directly to EC2. Security Groups are actually applied to 
Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs), which are attached to EC2 instances. If you detach an ENI and attach it 
to another instance, the same Security Group rules apply.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Amazon recommends SG for whitelisting and NACL for blacklisting. Additionally use WAF for vulnarabilities.
Note that allow/deny option against rules is available is NACL only. Not available in SG. Because SG rules are whitelisting.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Key Differences Between NACLs and Security Groups"
Feature				Network ACL (NACL)				Security Group
Scope		Subnet level (applies to all instances in the subnet).	Instance level (applies to specific instances).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
State				Stateless 				   Stateful 
	(requires explicit rules for both inbound and outbound traffic)    (return traffic is automatically allowed).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		Rule Processing	Rules are processed in order, 		   All rules are evaluated together; 
		starting from the lowest numbered rule.			   the most permissive rule applies.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Default Behavior	Default NACL allows all traffic 		   Default Security Group denies all inbound 
		(custom NACL denies all traffic by default).		   and allows all outbound traffic.

Q. If NACL specifies HTTP denied, Security group specifies HTTP allowed, then?
A. The NACL rule takes precedence and the traffic will be denied. This is because NACLs operate at the subnet level, and traffic must pass through the NACL rules before it reaches the Security Group.
Flow of Traffic Evaluation
Inbound Traffic:

When traffic enters a subnet, the NACL's inbound rules are evaluated first.
If the NACL denies the traffic (e.g., HTTP), it will not reach the EC2 instance, regardless of the Security Group rules.
Outbound Traffic:

When traffic exits an instance, the Security Group's outbound rules are evaluated first.
If allowed by the Security Group, the NACL's outbound rules are then evaluated. If the NACL denies the traffic, it will not leave the subnet.

PrivateLink and Lattice
=========================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VPC endpoint - Allows you to securely connect your VPC to another service like S3, DynamoDB, SES(Simple Email service).
Endpoints can help reduce NAT gateway charges and improve security by accessing S3 directly from the VPC. By default, full access policy is used. You can customize this policy at any time.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VPC Endpoint Service 
	You can use PrivateLink technology to make services in your VPC available to other AWS accounts and services.
	PrivateLink is a highly available, scalable technology that enables private access to services.
	Other accounts and services can create an interface endpoint to access your endpoint service
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Target Group
- Target groups is a logical grouping of targets (such as EC2 instances, IP addresses, or AWS Lambda functions) within a 
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) that are used by load balancers to route incoming requests. 
- They are associated with Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs), including Application Load Balancers (ALBs), Network Load Balancers (NLBs), and Gateway Load Balancers (GLBs).
- They manage:
	- Routing traffic intelligently across multiple resources
	  (e.g., distributing traffic to multiple EC2 instances or containers).
	- Performing health checks to ensure only healthy resources receive traffic. (like eureka?)
	- Deciding which resource to route traffic to based on rules (e.g., path-based or header-based routing).

Note: While Target Groups and AWS Load Balancers are sufficient for basic use cases, Istio provides advanced service mesh capabilities ideal for Kubernetes-based, microservices-heavy architectures. 
Note: Target groups are available in EC2 dashboard also. The form to create looks similar. But TGs create in VPC dashboard
are not visible in EC2 dashboard and vice versa.(This is my observation)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Virtual Private Gateway - used for making VPN connection. VPN connections costs money depending on usage and amount of data transfer.

=========================================
DNS Firewall  

=========================================
=========================================
Network firewall
=========================================
While Security Groups and Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) are effective for basic network security in AWS, AWS Network Firewall provides a more advanced layer of security for more complex and evolving security needs. Here's why AWS Network Firewall is useful even when Security Groups and NACLs are in place:


Feature		Security Groups			|NACLs				|AWS Network Firewall
Scope	Instance-level (operates on ENI).	|Subnet-level (stateless rules)	|VPC-level (integrates with route tables).
Statefulness	Stateful.			|Stateless.			|Stateful and stateless rules supported.
Rule Complexity	Simple, allows/denies traffic.	|Simple, allows/denies traffic.	|Complex rules for intrusion detection 
											and prevention.
Protocol Support	TCP, UDP, ICMP.		|TCP, UDP, ICMP.		|Deep packet inspection for 
											Layer 3â€“7 traffic.
Advanced Features	Basic.			|Basic.				|Includes IPS/IDS, traffic filtering, 
										 and domain blocking.

Transit Gateways
=========================================
(hub-and-spoke )- Added later, better alternative to VPC Peering. It connects all VPCs.
You can attach up to 5000 VPCs to each gateway and each attachment can handle up to 50 Gbits/second of bursty traffic-2018
 
 Question
 1. While creating VPC, we specify IPv4 CIDR block. If we put 10.0.0.1/24, it will generate 256 IP addresses. What if I just want 50 IP address.
 2. How do I decide between regional replication and zonal replication for various resources like s3, dynamodb?
 A. S3 is at regioanl level.
 
 3.EC2/Fargate instance can crash, ECS can rebuild a new instance. What if a subnet/AZ crash, or a VPC crash? Who will recreate it?
 
 4. In the same AWS account can I create 2 VPCs with same CIDR - 10.100.0.0/16 and again 10.100.0.0/16? Consider VPC in same region, different region.
 
 5. After configuring the network, can I export it.
 6. How VPC flowlog is different from cloudwatch?
 
 7. There was a default VPC in Oregon region with IPv4/CIDR 171.31.0.0/16. Can I create a new VPC in same region with same IPv4/CIDR?
 A. Yes. But I think it can create problem during peering between them. Verify.

 8. Can you create more than one internet gateway withing one VPC?
 A. No. When attaching an igw to a vpc, only those vpc appears in the drop down which doesnt have an igw attached. 
 
 9. Route table per region, per vpc or per AZ/subnet?
 10. If AZ and subnet is 1 to 1 mapped why there was a need for these two construct? Cant they be clubbed as one?
 11. Can a subnet be associated with more than 1 route table? Vice versa?
 12. For VPC, when to enable/disable DNS resolution?
 13. A VPN's IPv4 CIDR is 10.0.0.0/24. Its subnet 1 is 10.0.0.0/28, subnet 2 is 10.0.0.32/28. How many available IPv4 in both subnets? Console show 11. How?
 14. Why NACL sources are 0.0.0.0/0 but SG sources are security group id?
 15. There is no provision of creating more than one IPv4 CIDR for a user created VPC. Buth there are two CIDR for the default VPC. Why?
 16. If I associated an IGW to a subnet making it public, but in the associated NACL, I denied all inbound traffic, will this subnet be a public subnet?
 17. When does it makes sense to create our own DHCP? 
 18. If I create more DHCP option set, how to change DHCP option set of a VPC?
 19. Verify two EC2 instances in 2 different subnet of same VPC are able to communicate.
 20. Why would I need more than one ENI for my EC2?
 A. 1. You can configure multiple ENIs on different subnets. If one fails, other will work.
    2. You can separate different types of traffic -public(Web), private(DB)

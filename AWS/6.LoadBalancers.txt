Load balancing.
Advantage -
  Spread load across multiple downstream
  Expose a single point of access(DNS) to your application
  Seemlessly handle the failure of downstream instances
  Regular health checks.
  High availability across zones.

Types:
Gateway
NLB
ALB
Classic

Architectures:
1. Public ALB received all request. Public ALB sends request to private ALB. Private ALB distributes request to EC2. 
  What is the advantage of having public/private ALB?
2. Public NLB receives all request. 
If your ALB is private (inside a VPC and not internet-facing), an NLB can  expose it externally.
By using the Target Group (target type ALB), the NLB can forward external requests to the private ALB, which then routes them to the correct backend services.


Assignment
1. Running ReactJS on multi EC2. Put a load balancer in front.
2. Restrict HTTP request to EC2 only from load balancer.
3. Allow load balancer to accept HTTP request from anywhere.

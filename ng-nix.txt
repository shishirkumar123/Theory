NGNIX - Web server since old days
	- load balancer
	- caching
	- consolidated, centralized sucurity. 
	- compression of response of high quality streaming data for faster delivery
		to millions of concurrent users (e.g Netflix)
		do the chunking of response rather than sending full file
	- these configuration is specified in nginx.conf file
	
	Below is a sample Nginx configuration file to set it up as a web server. This configuration serves a static website and includes some basic configurations for security and performance:

```nginx
			# Main Nginx Configuration
			user www-data;
			worker_processes auto;
			pid /run/nginx.pid;
			include /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/*.conf;

			events {
				worker_connections 1024;
			}

			http {
				# Log format for requests
				log_format main '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
								  '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
								  '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';

				access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log main;
				error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log warn;

				# File limits and timeouts
				sendfile on;
				tcp_nopush on;
				tcp_nodelay on;
				keepalive_timeout 65;
				types_hash_max_size 2048;

				include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
				default_type application/octet-stream;

				# Gzip Settings for performance
				gzip on;
				gzip_disable "msie6";
				gzip_vary on;
				gzip_min_length 10240;
				gzip_proxied any;
				gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript text/xml application/xml application/xml+rss text/javascript;

				# Server block for your website
				server {
					listen 80; # Listen on port 80 for HTTP requests
					server_name example.com www.example.com; # Replace with your domain

					root /var/www/example.com/html; # Path to your site's root directory
					index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

					# Security Headers
					add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN;
					add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
					add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";

					# Log files
					access_log /var/log/nginx/example.com_access.log;
					error_log /var/log/nginx/example.com_error.log warn;

					# Location for static files
					location / {
						try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
					}

					# Optional: Deny access to sensitive files
					location ~ /\.ht {
						deny all;
					}
				}

				# Include other site configurations if necessary
				include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
				include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;
			}
			```

			### Key Features:
			- **Server Block**: Defines the root directory for the website and sets up basic security headers.
			- **Gzip**: Enabled for performance to compress text-based resources.
			- **Access Control**: `.htaccess` and other sensitive files are protected.
			- **Log Format**: Configures how Nginx logs incoming requests.

			Make sure to replace `example.com` with your actual domain, and adjust paths as necessary for your environment.

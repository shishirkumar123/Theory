APIM
====
Create API service -> Needs Application insights -> Needs Log Analytics workspace
Onboard API using OpenAPI(swagger)/Azure function etc.
Create Product
	There is a subscription attached to a product. 
	API consumer need to get subscription key to use product
Create Group - mapped to ??
Create User - mapped to group
Attach policy - 
	at global,product, API, operation level (Note: Operations are present inside an API)
	to specify rate-limit, quota call, allow CORS, cache response, transformation etc.
	


Generate subscription key
	-Admin can do it
	-Consumer of the API can also do it through dev portal
	

Consumer of the API will see list of APIs that have been mapped for this user using group/product
Consumer of the API can generate subscription key and send request along with this key.
	We can enable 'Approval required' for subscription key generation process.

Versioning - Create new version of an API. Option available when you browse the API.
Authentication policies
	Options - Basic, client certificate, managed identity
	
OAuth2 - API doesnt directly provide OAuth2 implementation but integrates with Identity provider(IP)
		IP should be OAuth2/OpenId complient(e.g., Azure Active Directory (AAD), Auth0,

=====================
Policies can be attached to different levels-
	Global API level
	product level
	Operation level within an API
Revision
	One one revision is valid at a time
Version
	Multiple versions can coexits.
	Caller specify version number in query string/path param

Throttle
	Based on size
	Based on number of calls
Cache
	Internal
		Policies
			Remove value from Cache
	External(Prefer internal, external will add to bills)
		Redis
CORS
	allow other domains to access APIs
	
Transformation policies
	Inbount Processing/Outbound Processing
	Helps making sure we are not exposing
		-Backend URLs
		-Backend Technologies, versions
		
Advance policies
	condition logic -
	<inbound>
		<choose>
			<when>
				<set>...
	<backend>
	<outbound>
	-----
	Retry - 
	<retry condition="" count = "">
	----
	Add trace for debugging
	
Infrastructure for APIM
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0HN8ODhHjQ&list=PLDUPL1iASgCwBa00t1fTqZrclVWip4THZ&index=15
	Vnet
		public - get only one url/private
		subnet1 -put APIM. remember to do subnet delegation 
				so that VM in different subnet but same Vnet can access APIM
		subnet 2 - Virtual m/c - connect using Bastion. Try to access APIM in subnet 1.
		
API Gateway
	Scenario - You have both internal and external consumers for API.
	Solution - Go for two APIM -Costly
	Better solution - API Gateway
	API gateway will be on public subnet, APIM will be on private subnet.
	Steps
		Create keyvoult. Generate a certificate there.
		Create API gateway,
			-attach keyvoult, certificate there. 
			-create new subnet
			-assign a public ip to API gateway
			-attach backend (ip of APIM)
			-add routing rules
			-create healthprobe in gatetway

APIM Authentication policies
	Basic					<authentication-basic username="username" password="password" />
	Client Certificate		<authentication-certificate thumbprint="thumbprint" certificate-id="resource name" body="certificate byte array" password="optional password"/>
	Managed identity		<authentication-managed-identity resource="resource" client-id="clientid of user-assigned identity" output-token-variable-name="token-variable" ignore-error="true|false"/>
	



===================

Different SLAs are offered and priced accordingly.
I tried the cheapest one which is developer tier with no sla. This cost $50/month(1/24/2025) 
do I didn't proceed. Sob :(

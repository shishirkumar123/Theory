Azure Open AI: To use pretrained models
--------------------
Steps:
Create an Azure OpenAI Service in the Azure Portal.
Deploy the model (e.g., GPT-4, Codex, or DALLÂ·E).
Use REST API or SDK (Python, .NET, etc.) to call the model.

 Azure ML Workspace
-------------------------
For training custom ML models or fine-tuning models.
Creating ML pipelines, experiments, or AutoML.
Working with custom datasets and need managed ML training.

Quick start
	1. Create a storage account to upload your dataset that will be used to build your model.
	2. Within the storage account, create a container.
	3. Within the container, you have option to upload your data file(txt, json etc) for training.
	4. Create an Azure AI Language resource, get the credentials
	5. Create a project 
	6. Connect the project with storage and start training a model.

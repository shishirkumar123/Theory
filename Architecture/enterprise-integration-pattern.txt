                 relevant messages reach the intended system.

Splitter:  A Splitter is used to break a single large message into multiple smaller messages for 
          parallel or separate processing. This is useful when dealing with batch data or composite messages.

Use case:  E-commerce → Process each order item separately
           Financial transactions → Split batch payments into individual transactions
          Log processing → Break large log files into smaller messages

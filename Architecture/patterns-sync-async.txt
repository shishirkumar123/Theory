Asynchronous Mode
 For event-driven architectures → Kafka, Pub/Sub, RabbitMQ.
 For real-time communication → WebSockets, WebRTC.
        Unlike a synchronous HTTP request (where the client waits for a response), a WebSocket keeps 
        the connection open, allowing both sides to communicate freely and asynchronously.
 For background job processing → Message Queues i.e point to point (SQS, RabbitMQ, Celery).
 For API responses without blocking → Async/Await, Callbacks, gRPC Streaming.

Data Pipeline
Collect -> Ingest -> Compute -> Store -> Consume
Or
Collect -> Ingest -> Store -> Compute -> Consume


Collect
	Collect from various data source
	1. Streaming - AWS Kinesis, Apache Kafka Stream, IoT devices
	2. Batch Process - MySQL, DynamoDB, SQL Server, Oracle
	3. CDC from Database - MySQL, DynamoDB, SQL Server, Oracle
	Collected data go to landing using either of the two
	1. Simple data load 
	2. Even Queue - Apache Kafka
	
Ingest
	Keep raw data in landing area

Compute
	Two Types
	1. Batch Processing - Apache Spark, Hadoop/Hive
	2. Stream processing - Apache Flink, Google cloud Dataflow, Apache Storm, Apache Samza

	Steps - 
	ETL/ELT - Apache Airflow/ AWS Glue
	Extract-Transform-Load or -Extract-Load-Transform 
		Data aggregation
		Data cleaning
		Data normalization
		Data enrichment
		- ETL Tools 
			- Apache nifi
				Open-source, flow-based platform.
				Real-time data integration.
				Ideal for IoT and streaming data pipelines.
			- Informatica
				Enterprise-grade, commercial tool.
				Robust data governance and MDM (Master Data Management).
				Strong automation and scalability for large enterprises.
			- Talend 
				Open-source and commercial options.
				User-friendly, especially for ETL developers.
				Strong support for cloud and big data platforms.
		
		Data is processed and stored in parque/avro/odc format 
	
Store
	Data Warehouse(Conformed): Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, Teradata, Greenplum
	Data mart 				 : subset of DWH like billing DM, sales DM. Data is duplicated.
	Data Lake(Curated)		 : S3, HDFS (format - parque, avro). Horizontal Scaling.
	Data Lakehouse	

	DWH are vertically scaled, data lake is horizontally scaled.
	DWH is costlier than Data lake.
	[Snowflake  - Often referred to as a "data platform" that bridges the gap 
				  between data lakes and warehouses.]
	
Use/Consume
	Data Science			
		Tools - NumPi, Tensorflow, PiTorch, Panda.   
		Use case - For prediction(e.g customer churn)
	Business Intelligence	
		Tools - Tableau, Power BI					 
		Use Case - Visualization( Interactive dashboards, reports)
	Self service
		Tools - looker, looker ML
	Machine learning services
		e.g Fraud detection

Notes from Manish Kumar Lectures

DWH layers

Extract (Ingestion)
	- Staging layer  - Scoop, Ingestion
		Types:
		Persistent - after it is sent to next layer(user access layer), data is kept
			If DWH got corrupted, need to go back to source system
			Require less storage.
		Non persistent - after it is sent to next layer(user access layer), data is deleted
			More storage is required. Need to take care of data governance.
			But data backup is there.
	-User access layer
		
		
Transform data
	Uniformity - same type data
	Restructuring - Same structure(columns)
	Common transformation
		Data value unification - US, U.S.A., United States -> USA
		Data type and unification - char, varchar(25), varchar(35) -> varchar(35)
		Deduplication - remove duplicate records resulted due to same data coming from different sources
		Drop columns - audit columns etc not needed by DWH
		Drop record - Hard delete the stale data
		Common Known Error - e.g replace null with avg value.
		
Load. 2 types
	Initial load
		Done only once (before going live)
	Incremental load
		Reason-
			New data (new customer, product)
			Modified data( product price change, employee promoted)
			Delete data (employee resigned (inactive))
		Types- 
			Append - add at the end 
			In place update - replace. history gone?
			complete replacement - rarely done
			rolling append - Lets say we decided to keep last two years data only.
							And we do update once a month.
							So every month new data will arrive, 
							and oldest one month data will be moved out.

Design engineering
	Dimentional modeling
		Fact Table - measurement - keep data (kind of transaction data)
		Dimention Table - context - provide context about the data to understand the meaning
		Fact table can join with dimention table to make it more meaningful and create new fact table.
	
	Steps (all these steps looks like database design to me)
		Understand the business - familiarize with data and get the end goal for analysis
		Declare the grain - grain means level of detail available in a record
				so that analysis can be done. Grain level needs to increate if
				more granularity is needed. It will lead to more space requirement.
		Identify the dimentions needed to join.
		Identify number of fact tables to be created.
		Derived fact - from SP and CP, derived profit. can keep this in additional column in fact table
		[Data modeler prefer View over derived columns to save storage space]
	Types of facts in fact table
		Additivity
			Additive facts - can add fact along any dimention
			Semi additive facts - can add for along with some dimention only
				e.g
				1. Qty(prod 1)+ Qty(prod 2) on a given day for store S003 can be added 
					to find total sales	for that store but, Quantity on hand for say 3 
					days can't be added. It doent have any meaning.
			Non additive facts - cant add for any. 
				e.g 
				1. normal price and discounted price can't be added to find unit price?
				2. temperature cant be added in time dimention. Yest was 30, today is 45. But cant add.
				3. % profit
				
	Type of fact tables
		Transaction fact table(insert): 
			e.g.POS data. 
			can have billions of records 
		Periodic snapshot fact table(insert/append).
			Qty on hand of a product every day is a periodic snapshot
			If I have to find a perticuar product movement, better to find 
			here in periodic table.
			Issue - If say 1000 product and 10000 store so every day 10,0000000 records
			So we keep the limit on no. of days we keep the data for. Like last 2 days.
		Accumulating  snapshot fact table.(update)
			Number of records remain same, their values keep updating.
			Number of records increase only for new entity, like new product transaction
		Factless fact table?? (Only dimention)
			e.g 
			1. table 'promotion_coverage_fact_tbl' 
				fields date_id, product_id, store_id, promotion_id
				This can answer the question - Which product didnt sell even after promo.
			2. table 'student_attendence_fact_tbl'
				fields date_id, student_id, course_id, instructor_id.
				This can answer the question - 75% attendence in a course?
	
	Dimention table - TODO

	Star Schema vs Snowflake Schema
	Star schemas are easier and better for performance, 
	while snowflake schemas focus on storage optimization and flexibility in complex databases.

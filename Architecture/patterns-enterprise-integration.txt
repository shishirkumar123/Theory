Message Filter:  
    used to remove unwanted messages from a message stream, ensuring that only 
    relevant messages reach the intended system.
Use case:  
    Fraud detection systems (filtering suspicious transactions)
    IoT data processing (filtering sensor noise)
    Stock trading platforms (filtering high-value trades)
---------------------
Splitter:  
    A Splitter is used to break a single large message into multiple smaller messages for 
    parallel or separate processing. This is useful when dealing with batch data or composite messages.
Use case:  
    E-commerce → Process each order item separately
    Financial transactions → Split batch payments into individual transactions
    Log processing → Break large log files into smaller messages

---------------------
Content-Based Router: 
    routes messages to different destinations based on their content. This helps in dynamic 
    message routing based on specific conditions.
Use case:
    Customer service → Route requests to different teams (e.g., billing vs. technical support)

---------------------
Recipient List:
    Dynamically sends a message to multiple recipients based on conditions or metadata. 
    Unlike a publish-subscribe pattern (which broadcasts to all subscribers), the Recipient List 
    selectively chooses recipients at runtime.
Use case:
    An e-commerce platform processes an order and needs to send notifications:
    Customer → Order confirmation
    Warehouse → Shipping details
    Accounting → Billing
    A Recipient List determines which recipients should receive the notification based on order details.

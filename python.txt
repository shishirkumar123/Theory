Python
============
Initial steps
1. Install python 3.12.3
2. Install VSCode
3. Install python extensions recommended by vscode (like python, python debugger, pylance)
4. Create new folder to keep python files and select that folder to create a project in vs code.
5. First file - hello.py
6. First program
	print("Hello")
7. a.Run it through menu option Run>>Run without debugging

>python -m venv myenv
	This will
		-create a new folder in project having same name as env-name.
		-show notice from VS Code to have it as a workspace folder- click Yes

===============================
Functional programming in Python
Immutability becomes important in multithreaded environment. Immutable objects cant be
modifies so there are no synchronization issues.
=============================
Python 3.13 introduces experimental features like free threading and JIT (JIT) compilation 
that can significantly enhance performance in computationally intensive workloads, 
which are common in ML training and

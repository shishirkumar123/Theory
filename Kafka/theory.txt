Running console based Kafka 
===========================
.\bin\windows\zookeeper-server-start.bat .\config\zookeeper.properties
.\bin\windows\kafka-server-start.bat .\config\server.properties
.\bin\windows\kafka-topics.bat --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic promotion
.\bin\windows\kafka-console-producer.bat --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic promotion
.\bin\windows\kafka-console-consumer.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic promotion --from-beginning
----
List of Topics -
.\bin\windows\kafka-topics.bat --list --zookeeper localhost:2181
Delete a Topic
.\bin\windows\kafka-topics.bat --delete --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topic test [work only if delete.topic.enable is set to true]
[This only marks for deletion. When does actual deletion happens? If you fire 'describe' on the deleted Topic, you may get some info with MarkedForDeletion:true]
Describe a Topic -
.\bin\windows\kafka-topics.bat --describe --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topic test

Create partition during topic creation
.\bin\windows\kafka-topics.bat --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 5 --topic promotion1

Consume from a topic specifying group
.\bin\windows\kafka-console-consumer.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic promotion1 --group 1

Consume from a topic specifying partition and offset
.\bin\windows\kafka-console-consumer.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic promotion1 --partition 0 --offset 61
[if specifying offset, you must specify partition]

Note that partition is not specified during publishing. Once a producer start publishing, the content goes evenly to all partitions.
[Observation - For all the message that I published, one message got occupied in one offset] 

Q1. What will happen if you have only one broker, but you are trying to create topic with replication factor 3?
A1.org.apache.kafka.common.errors.InvalidReplicationFactorException: Replication factor: 3 larger than available brokers: 1.
Q2. How does Kafka ensure that the message is consumed only once?
A2. By setting appropriate levels of Delivery Guarantees-
	At-Least-Once Delivery (default)
	At-Most-Once Delivery
	Exactly-Once Semantics (EOS)
Q3. How does consumer decide from which replication to read? Leader's copy?

======================
Theory
--------
Kafka Server = Kafka Broker. Ideally 1 brocker on 1 m/c, but technically possible to have n broker(with different port) on 1 m/c
Kafka Cluster - Multiple Kafka Servers co-ordinates through Zookeeper.
Topic can be divided into multiple Partition
Each Partition can exist on different machine.
A partition cant be divided further into multiple machine. -- I dont think. Need verification.
Each Partition has offsets. How big is one offset? Offset number is not globally unique, but unique in partition.
So, to locate a meesage i need to know topic, partition number, offset number.
No of partition = no of consumers in a consumer group. CG can't be more- to avoid duple read. But can be less i guess.
If there are 4 brockers and I need 4 partitions each brocker can have one partiotion.
But if I have one brocker and I need 2 partition, both partition will reside on same brocker.

Replication factor is associated with Topic.
For a given Topic, if replication factor is say 3, then one broker is nominated a leader for each partition. Only leader talks to Producer and Consumer for that Topic and sends acknowledgement to producer. 
Leader maintains first copy of replication, followers maintain rest.
Q. Is it possible that I have 3 partitions on 3 brockers... partition 1 leader is broker 2, but partition 2 leader is broker 3?
A. Yes.
Q. In other words, leader is at partition level or topic level?
A. partition level.
Use command kafka-topic describe to see these details. It shows leader of each partition. It also shows replica ids and ISR ids.
(ISR - In Sync Replicas)

Sending message requires properties - bootstrap.servers, serializer(to convert object into byte stream)
3 approach for sending - fire and forget, wait till acknowledgement(Future.get), async.
Serialization - Use default or Custom. When message object changes, need to update custom serializer accordingly. 
	But then old message cant be read with new Serializer. Avro helps in these situations.

If order is important then there are two ways to achieve it-
	1. Use Synchronous send
	2. set max.in.flight.request.per.connection = 1
	Of course, then guaranty comes at the cost of throughput.

Consumer - There is a construct consumer group which are set of related consumers working together to achieve high throughput. 
	A consumer is assigned to a partition. For a given consumer group, only single consumer can be assigned to partition.
	One of the Kafka broker is made Group co-ordinator. Group co-ordinator maintains list of consumers and initiates a rebalancing when a member enter/exit.
	First consumer of the group becomes the group leader, performs the rebalancing when a member enters/exits.
	One consumer can subscribe to list of topics.
	Consumer polls the topic in infinite loop. Optionally it can be given a scheduler so that it pools based on scheduler settings.
	Q. Why Kafka choose consumer polling approach. Why it didn't choose broker notifying consumer approach?
	
Offset
	Current Offset - Maintains current position of consumer read.
	Committed offset - Consumer has confirmed about processing.
	These offsets play a role in rebalancing

RebalanceListener

Partition assignment can be done by Kafka or us.

Common Configurations
--------------
broker.id - Unique identifier of broker.
port - Port on which broker runs.
log.dirs - the path where logs of broker will be written.

zookeeper.connect - using this broker knows where is zookeeper running.
delete.topic.enable
autocreate.topic.enable
default.replication.factor
num.partition
log.retention.ms - How long to keep message(Default 7 days)
log.retention.bytes - Max capacity of size of message a partition will hold. Beyond that, Kafka will do the cleanup.

Producer specific configuration
--------------------------------
ack - Acknowledgement is required from broker to producer. If set to all, then the leader broker will confirm from all 
	the follower broker whether message was successfully received, then only send the acknowledgement message.(slowest)
retries
max.in.flight.request.per.connection - how many in flight request is allowed that are still not acknowledged.

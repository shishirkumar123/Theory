Principal
==========
 A principal is an entity that can be authenticated and is recognized by the security system. 
 Principals can include: User accounts, Computer accounts, Group accounts. 

Keystore and TrustStore
==========
Keystore is used to store your credential (server or client)  
TrustStore is used to store others credential (Certificates from CA)

Handshake
=========
A handshake is a process that establishes a secure connection between two parties, 
such as a client and server.
For an example, look into Git/theory.txt

Chain of trust - qs. If everyone trust CA and through CA each other, then where is chain of trust?
There is no chain but a central authority. Correct?

PKI - Public key infrastructure
=================================
Symmetric Key - Same key is used for encrypt/decrypt
Asymetric key - Different key is used for encrypt/decrypt (Public/Private)
CA Certs - Entities distribute their public key using certificate signed by CA(Certificate Authority)

=====================

Process:
# Client and server needs to communicate securely.
# CA provides CA cert having CA's public key to both client and server
	This CA cert is aggreed upon by client and server.
# Client keeps CA cert in its truststore. Server too?
# Server keeps it private, public key in key store.
	It also keeps server cert signed by CA?
	It also keeps CA cert. Here or in trust store?

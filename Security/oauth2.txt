Oauth2 vs subscription key
====================================
When to Use OAuth2 Instead of (or Alongside) Subscription Keys
  - If you need user authentication and role-based authorization.
  - If you want short-lived access tokens instead of long-lived keys.
  - If your API consumers are external, and you canâ€™t fully control key distribution.
 
------------------------
Notes
1. Oauth tokens can be opeque or JWT based. If all microservices has to inspect the token to validate whether caller have authorization for this microservice,
opeque token will not work. It has to be JWT based open token.
2.OAuth and SSL\TLS are two separate layers of the OSI model. OAuth is for authorizatio and is at the top in Layer 7 
while SSL\TLS is for transport security in layer 4. It's easy to confuse SSL with client certificates because they both
use PKI.

Questions - 
1.Messaging scenario. If I have message broker like Kafka, SNS/SQS will the message contain access tokens also in the header?
Are these message supposed to have just the payload or can have headers also.
2. all microservice authenticating so if there are 3 microservice in chain, 
so complete the use case does the caller needs to have authorization to all 
the microservices in the chain or just the first one.
3. Client credential flow doesnt need Open id connect and can serve as authentication provider as well. Correct?
4.Openid connect can be used irrespective of OAuth2. Alternatively SAML.

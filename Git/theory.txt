You need SSH or HTTP to interact with git server.


===============================================================---

### 🔑 What Happens After SSH Keys Are Generated?

After you generate a key pair (`private` and `public`), the SSH communication works like this:

---

### 🧠 Core Concept: **Asymmetric Cryptography**

- You have:
  - A **private key**: Kept **secret** and secure on your machine.
  - A **public key**: Shared and stored on the **server** (e.g., GitHub, a Linux server, etc.)

These keys are mathematically linked, but you **cannot derive the private key from the public key**.

---

### 🛰️ SSH Communication Process (Simplified)

1. **Connection Initiation**:
   - You run:  
     ```bash
     ssh user@host
     ```
     or  
     ```bash
     git clone git@github.com:user/repo.git
     ```

2. **Server Sends a Challenge**:
   - The server checks if it has your **public key**.
   - If yes, it sends a **random challenge** (like a cryptographic puzzle), encrypted using **your public key**.

3. **Client Decrypts Challenge**:
   - Your machine uses the **private key** to decrypt this challenge.
   - Only the correct private key can do this.

4. **Client Responds**:
   - It sends back a **proof of decryption** (like a signature).

5. **Server Verifies**:
   - The server uses your **public key** to verify that the response is correct.
   - If it checks out — it knows:
     - The client holds the correct private key.
     - The connection is legit.

6. **Secure Session Established**:
   - Now both sides use symmetric encryption (faster) for the rest of the session.
   - The identity was verified **without ever transmitting the private key or password**.

---

### 🔐 Key Takeaway

> The server challenges you, and only your private key can solve it. The private key **never leaves your machine**. That’s what makes SSH key-based auth **secure and passwordless**.

---

### 🧪 Bonus: In Git usage

When you do:
```bash
git push origin main
```

And you’re using SSH:
- Git connects to GitHub using SSH.
- GitHub checks your public key.
- The same handshake above happens.
- If verified, GitHub allows your push.

No password or token is involved if your key is trusted.

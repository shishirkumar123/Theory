Kubernates
=======================
Deployment environment

3 runtime environments - 
Physical server virtual m/c, containers. Comparison:
Physical server - high CAPEx, OPEx
Virtual m/c - Faster server provisioning. But various OS occupy huge space. Still high on CAPEx, OPEx, needs OS licence.
Containers - virtualize at OS level. Contrast this with VMs that virtualizes at hardware level.
	(Q - what about different types of VM, some sitting between OS and hardware other at the top of OS?)

	Containers are very light weight compared to VM. good for microservices, not for monolithic
	advantage of containers - portability, isolation, resource efficiency, speed, scaling
	Famous container - Docker, Rocket(Rkt)
Virtual m/c's are more mature in terms of security

Conclusion - create container at the top of virtual m/c - this could be ideal match.
-----------------------------------------------
Docker 
Docker Inc products - Docker swarm, docker hub, docker data centre.
Docker = Dockyard + worker, written in Go(Google). It builds(docker image), ships(docker hub/store) and runs(docker container) s/w.
docker hub - community(no verification.) vs docker store
Terms - images, repositories(public/private) and dockerhub. As of Dec 2018 - 5 million download /day 2 billion/year
Docker Ink sell container technology, Docker Project - community
--------------------------------
Container orchestration 
	is required for managing, deploying and scaling. e.g. kebernates, docker swarm(docker inc.), marathon(apache mesos)
	2 most important feature - clustering and scheduling, scaling, load balance, fault tolerance, deployment(recreate, rolling-update/canary)
	All three major cloud provider has their own container engine. GCP - Kubernates, Amazon EC2 container service, Azure container service. But Kubernates can be used in all platform.
	large team- kubernates, small team docker swarm/rancher/nomad


=========Side note=========
Blue-green deployment - switch from blue to green or vice versa in one go. Good for less downtime.
canary - route request to new deployment for small set of user, then increase gradually. Good for introducing new feature.

==========End==============
---------------------------------
Kubernates architecture
Master node, Worker Node.
Master Node
	API gateway and API Server - Receive and coordinate(validate/execute etc) all request for CRUD operations on kubernates objects
	Scheduler - Associate pods to the appropriate nodes based on pods resource requirement.
	etcd - key value database for keeping information about current cluster states (master, workers, status etc)
	controller manager - 4 controllers - node controller, replication controller, endpoint controller, service accountant token controller. 
			Ensures overall health. Ensures correct numbers of pods are up and running as per the requirement specs.
	Usually master node doesn't contain pods
--------------
Worker node >> Pods >> container. Multiple master/worker nodes form clusters. Also-
	kubelet - manage containers. - start, detect failure, restart, shift to a different pod/node.
                 - interacts with containeers as well as nodes
	kube-proxy - maintain network configuration, forwards the requests
	pods/containers

===========================================
installation
-------------
https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/
Minikube - master-worker single pkg with preinstalled docker (pre-requisite: virtualization)
kubeadm -  multi node kubernates cluster
cloud based - google kebernates engine(GKE), Amazon ECS(Elastic container services), Azure kubernates service(AKS) - just specify no. of nodes, and CPU/RAM requirement.
physical - install kubeadm, kubelet, kubectl, docker
-------------------------------------------------------
Installation Steps
-------------------
how to create and manage K8s.


1. Create 4 VMs - master(1) and worker(3) nodes
2. PRE-Reqs: Disable - Firewall | Swap | SELinux. Disable swap for better performance
3. Download & Install - Docker | Kubelet | Kubeadm | Kubectl
4. Configure the Kubernetes "master" node
5. Join "worker" nodes to the cluster[currently K8s support up to 5000 worker nodes/cluster]
6. Testing use case
===================================
Play with k8s -
----------------
Bootstrap a cluster
----------------------
You can bootstrap a cluster as follows:
On master :
 1. Initializes cluster master node:
 kubeadm init --apiserver-advertise-address $(hostname -i) --pod-network-cidr 10.5.0.0/16
 At this moment kubectl get node will show node status as "NotReady"

 2. Initialize cluster networking:
 kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/

old - kubectl apply -n kube-system -f "https://cloud.weave.works/k8s/net?k8s-version=$(kubectl version | base64 |tr -d '\n')"
 At this moment kubectl get node will show node status as "Ready"
 3. (Optional) Create an nginx deployment:
 kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/website/master/content/en/examples/application/nginx-app.yaml
 
[NGINX - Web server for load balancing, caching, and centralized security]
-------------

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
  
----------------------------------

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:
>>
>>kubeadm join 192.168.0.28:6443 --token 9mm7z2.s5q5nek0ez40xicy --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:c7b9f819a794e1796018630ce3ee1f3b7e5244f47e4c063fb817aafca3580969
[-----------------------------------------------------------------
| Note : 
|    create vs apply
|    kubectl create is imparative, kubectl apply is declarative
|    create - will create from scratch, throw error if already exists
|    apply  - can create if doesn't exists, update if exists. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------]

Test:
>kubectl get no
>kubectl run kubernates-bootcamp --image=gcr.io/google-samples/kubernates-bootcamp:v1 --port=8080
>kubectl get po
-----------------
================================================= 

Use - init master, setup pod network, join worker to master
>kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=10.240.0.0/16
>kubectl apply -f \ <url for network plugin, e.g flannel> ->needs to be done on master node
>kubeadm join --token <token> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash <value>. Token expires in 24 hrs so use below to recreate-
>kubeadm token create --print-join-command
check status-
>kubectl get no
run deployment
>kubectl run kubernates-bootcamp --image <value> --port <value>
>kubectl get po

Question - Can I create pod, rs, deployment, svc etc in master node itself? Why I need worker node? What happens to master node when worker node fails?
-----------------------------------
Pods
------
Pod is the atomic unit of scheduling in k8s. It is the run time environment.[Atomic unit for scheduling in virtualization if VM, in containerization it is container]
Pod Deployment - generate manifest file(container images). API server deploy it on appropriate worker node. labels comes handy when searching pods.
How we scale? add more container to pod or add more pod? Answer is add more pod, dont know why? If current node has no sufficient capacity, then add new VM
Usually there is one container per pod. In some cases there are more than one, but those container are related. One is main other(s) are helper.
Pod has its own internal IP.

===============================================
Replication controller - Maintains the no of Pod instances based on replication factor. RF can be 1 too.
Advantage - high availability, load balancing. Load needs to be balanced both across pods and nodes.
RC and pods are associated using label. 
Create and display RC
>kubectl create -f nginx-rc.yaml
>kubectl get pods
>kubectl get pod -l app=nginx-app
>kubectl describe rc nginx-rc
exercise - 
	1. kill a node and then check status of that pod(ans - unknown)
	2. scaleup - kubectl scale rc nginx-rc --replicas=5 - check the effect, find more pods added. some on Node 1 other on node 2.
	3. scale down. Delete the extra pods. - kubectl delete -f nginx-rc.yaml
selectors and labels - controllers are serices needs these to know more about pods that they need to manage.
	Related pods have same label.
	Selectors - Old - equality based(=, ==(same as=), !=), New set based(in, notin, exists)
-----------------
Replica set - advance version of replication controller. This has set based selectors as opposed the RC which has equality based selectors
	do same exercises as replication controller
	
	
=========================================================
Deployment - blueprint of pod

Replica set doesn't provide features such as Upgrades and rollbacks. For these we need deployments.
We can also do scale up, scale down, pause and resume deployment. 
Deployment type - 
	recreate - shut down V1 completely, then upgrade to V2. needs downtime. 
	RollingUpdate(default) - updates instances one by one.(Ramped or Incremental). Total upgrade takes time. 
	Canary - Gradual shift of prod traffic from v1 to v2 across multiple instances. Upgrade few instance, test and upgrade more. Ideal for testing before shifting 100%
	blue/green - switch at load balancer - advantage instant rollout/rollback. But wont it consume double the resource?
Create and display deployment-
>kubectl create -f nginx-deploy.yaml
>kubectl get deploy -l app=nginx-app
>kubectl get rs -l app=nginx-app
>kubectl get pod -l app=nginx-app -- NOTE: We dont explicitly create pod.
                                    When deployement is created, number of pods are created.
                                    The number depends on what was specified in deployment yaml file (e.g replicas: 2)
                                    When you do 'get po', the name of the pod follows the prefix of deployment name.
>kubectl get pod -n lcapsbx
>kubectl describe deploy nginx-deployment
Update using two options set and edit
>kubectl set image deploy nginx-deployment nginx-container=nginx:1.9.1
>kubectl edit deploy nginx-deployment
Verify
>kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment
>kubectl get deploy
Update and rollback
>kubectl set image deploy nginx-deployment nginx-container=nginx:1.91(missed "." between 9 and 1)
>kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment
>kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment
>kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment
>kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment
Scale up and down
>kubectl scale deployment nginx-deployment ==replicas=5
>kubectl get deploy
>kubectl get po
>kubectl scale deployment nginx-deployment ==replicas=1
>kubectl delete -f nginx-deploy.yaml

=====================================================================
Labels and selectors

Labels are set of name value pair. (user defined)
Lets understand with example. A service wants to route request to 3 out of 8 pods.
How will it refer to the three pods? It will refer using label. 
'label' will be mentioned in pod specification. 
         example
               label:
                   my-pod-types:my-favorite-pods
'selector' will be mentioned in service specification
               selector:
                   my-pod-types:my-favorite-pods

Question: Name value pair can be put in deployment yaml file as well inside the env tag.
      		env:
                    -name: dbuser-name
                    -value: admin

The why we need configmap and secret?
================================
StatefulSet

Used as a blueprint for components which has state, typically database, 
syncronize between multiple instances of database
Maintaining statefulset in K8s is not easy, so db can be kept outside k8s cluster.


=====================================================================

ConfigMap and secret

ConfigMap - keep things like db url. dont put passwords here
Secret - keep credential, certificates etc in base64 encoded form.

If I need to configure db details, i will out db url in ConfigMap. 
I will put db id and password in secret.
==================================================================
Services 

Pods are frequently created and destroyed, getting a new IP address. Service is the way to discover them so that communication is not broken. Service has permanent ip. service can be public(UI app) or private(like database)
	Services group the related pods using labels and selectors.
Types 
	NodePort - Web-app exposed to outside world
	LoadBalancer - Balancing load across all nodes hosting Web-app or something exposed to outside
	Cluster IP - front-end pod connecting to back-end pod

pods hosting front end server can be given same label say - front-end. similarly  back-end. only front-end needs to be exposed outside.

NodePort
------------
Has below ports
	Node port - 30000 to 32767
	Service port - on service. service routs request to various target ip:port
	Target port - on pod
>kubectl create -f nginx-deploy.yaml
>kubectl create -f nginx-svc-np.yaml
>kubectl get service -l app=nginx-app
Confirm which node pod is running -
>kubectl get po -o wide
>kubectl describe svc <service-name>  //get service vs describe service: describe has much more details
We need to verify external ip/port of pod/service/node through display and describe command.
Access them all using curl-
curl http://<node/pod/service ip>:<port>
At the end cleanup everything
>kubectl delete svc <service-name> - this deletes svc and related pods. confirm.

LoadBalancer
---------------------
Node that using NodePort we exposed multiple nodes outside by providing public ip. Things are different when we use load balancer.
Load balancer ensures load is evenly balanced across all nodes.
Load balancer needs investment money-wise, so use wisely.
>kubectl create -f nginx-deploy.yaml
>kubectl create -f nginx-svc-lb.yaml
>kubectl get service -l app=nginx-app
>kubectl get po -o wide
>kubectl describe svc <service-name>
cleanup using delete - Deleting the service will delete the pods too. how? service and pods are linked through labels.

NodePort vs LoadBalancer
------------------------------
NodePort is simpler and works without a cloud provider, making it suitable for development or small-scale environments.
LoadBalancer provides more robust traffic management, ideal for production environments, but depends on cloud infrastructure.

Cluster IP
---------------------
Database should be exposed to calling service only not anyone else. Ensure this using cluster IP.
Cluster IP is default service type in K8s.

Storage Volumes
--------------------
Pods are ephemeral and stateless. statelessness gives better scalability. 
But apps running in pod may need statefullness.
Something needed to keep application data which will persists beyond pods's life-cycle. So we have storage volumes. Can be internal to K8s cluster or external to it. Few examples-
	empltyDir
	hostPath
	gcePersistentDisk
Once volumes is attached to the pod, all containers in the pod will have access to that pod.
Volume types
	Ephemeral - same lifetime as pods
	Durable - Beyond pods lifetime
emptyDir
	K8s create empltyDir volume on a worker node where a pod is scheduled.
	While pod is running, all containers inside it access this volume.
	once pod is removed from node, empltyDir is deleted forever.
	most common use of empltyDir is temporary space creation. Also share data between containers of same pod.
	>kubectl create -f test-ed.yaml
	>kubectl get po
	>kubectl exec test-ed df /cache
	>kubectl describe test-ed
	>kubectl delete po test-ed
hostPath
	mounts a file or directory from host node's file system into the pod.
	remains even after pod is terminated
	similar to docker volume
	only use when really required.
gcePersistentDisk(gce=google compute engine)
	volume mounts a gce persistent disk into the pod.
	data is persisted after pod termination
	can be mounted as read-only by multiple pods, but as read-write by single pod
	Same as AWS block store, Azure disk
	question - can this be shared across nodes?
===============
namespaces
It can be think of as virtual cluster inside K8s cluster
	organize resource in namespaces
	useful to separate environments - dev, stg, prod etc
	useful if multiple team sharing same cluster. e.g. with namespaces, different team can have same deployment name. Without it, team will override each other.
	Dont use for small number of resources and may be less than 10 users(Kbs recomends)
	Put access control on namespace so that authorize person uses certain namespaces. also, each namespace can have their limit for accessing resources.
	Each namespace should use their own configmap/secret even if going to use same resources
	4 namespaces are created by default
		default - where we create by default when no namespace specified.
		kube-node-lease - info about heartbeat of nodes. each node as associated lease object in this namespace
		kube-public - publically accessible data like configmap. other e.g -
			>kubectl cluster-info returns ip where master/dns is running
		kube-system - for system processes. dont touch it.
		kubernates-dashboard - only with minikube
	>kubectl get namespaces
	>kubectl create namespace my-namespace
		Better use conf file for creating a namespace to have a history
	how to use service of different namespace
	Components that can't live inside a namespace - PV, Nodes
	Get configmap if in default namespace:
	>kubectl get configmap
	Get configmap if in user defined namespace:
	>kubectl get configmap -n <namespace-name>
	Create config map in namespace
	>kubectl apply -f a-configmap.yaml --namespace=my-namespace
	Or,
	apiVersion: V1
	kind: ConfigMap
	metadata:
		name:
		namespace:
=========================================
External service vs ingress
------------------------------
Expose the UI app through browser using
1. External service
		use ip like https://12.23.12.12:3000
		in prod: https://my-app.com


So request first comes to ingress then forwarded to service.
